# NameCheap-DynamicIP-Updater
## What's the point of this script?
NameCheap already offers a client you can download, but i didn't want to have my computer running 24/7 just for it.
I have a Raspberry PI Zero W i use for general automation, so i made this little script to be run there.
I didn't include a timer inside the script itself, since i'm using *Cron* to run the script every minute.
